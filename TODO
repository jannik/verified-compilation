When doing final batch of search-and-replace in code:
- Replace equivalence with semantics preservation

Be consistent about empty lines before and after begin{judgement}/end{judgement}.
Search and replace, e.g. \end{judgement}\n\end{judgement}

Be consistent about references to corresponding code files.
