\subsection{Translation}

The main responsibility of the \slang-\mlang translation is to flatten function definitions.
Informally, $\slam{\sprog}$ is translated to $\mpushclos{\addr}$ and some $\mprog$ where $\addr$ points to the start of $\mprog$.

During translation, instructions are placed in front of the program being constructed, and so references to function bodies must be adjusted accordingly.
Let $\shift{\mprog}{\nat}$ denote the program $\mprog$ shifted by $\nat$, i.e. with each address $\addr$ (in $\mpushclos{\addr}$) replaced by $\addr + \nat$.
And let $\len{\mprog}$ denote the length of the program $\mprog$, i.e. the number of the instructions in $\mprog$.

We translate from \slang programs to \mlang programs using the following judgement:

\begin{judgement}{$\trasm{\sprog}{\mprog}$}
{$\sprog$ translates to $\mprog$}
%
\begin{prooftree}
  \ninf{$\trasm{\sprog}{\mprog}$}
  \uinf{$\trasm{\snum{\nat} \sseq \sprog}{\mpushnum{\nat} \mseq \shift{\mprog}{1}}$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
  \ninf{$\trasm{\sprog}{\mprog}$}
  \uinf{$\trasm{\svar{\bvar} \sseq \sprog}{\mpushvar{\bvar} \mseq \shift{\mprog}{1}}$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
  \ninf{$\trasm{\sprog}{\mprog}$}
  \ninf{$\trasm{\sprog_0}{\mprog_0}$}
  \binf{$\trasm{\slam{\sprog_0} \sseq \sprog}{\mpushclos{(\len{\mprog} + 1)} \mseq \shift{\mprog}{1} \mconcat \shift{\mprog_0}{(\len{\mprog} + 1)}}$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
  \ninf{$\trasm{\sprog}{\mprog}$}
  \uinf{$\trasm{\sapp \sseq \sprog}{\mcall \mseq \shift{\mprog}{1}}$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
  \ninf{$\trasm{\sprog}{\mprog}$}
  \uinf{$\trasm{\ssuc \sseq \sprog}{\minc \mseq \shift{\mprog}{1}}$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
  \ax{$\trasm{\send}{\mret \mseq \mend}$}
\end{prooftree}
%
\end{judgement}

This approach with shifting instructions results in a translation relation which, when executed as an Elf logic program, clearly runs in time quadratic in the program size.
However, it is possible to translate a \slang program in linear time by delaying shifts.

We also define a finalising translation judgement, which handles bookkeeping in order to satisfy the semantics:

\begin{judgement}{$\trasmfinal{\sprog}{\mprog}{\addr}$}
{$\sprog$ translates to $\mprog$, viewed as a full program starting at address $\addr$}
%
\begin{prooftree}
  \ninf{$\trasm{\sprog}{\mprog}$}
  \uinf{$\trasmfinal{\sprog}{\mhalt \mseq \shift{\mprog}{1}}{1}$}
\end{prooftree}
%
\end{judgement}
This means that the $0$'th instruction of any translated (full) program is $\mhalt$ (and $\mhalt$ never appears elsewhere).
And the starting address of any such program is $1$.

Again, this translation is clearly total; for every \slang program $\sprog$ there exists a \mlang program $\mprog$ and an address $\addr$ such that \trasmfinal{\sprog}{\mprog}{\addr}.

\Twelf
Twelf does indeed accept a \texttt{\%total} declaration on the translation judgement.
