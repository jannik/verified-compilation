\section{Introduction}

% Motiverende Ã¦vl.

There are several ways of ensuring the correctness of a compiler.
One way is through extensive testing, though in practice this is never quite sufficient to be rid of all errors [citation?].
Another way is to prove the correctness of the compiler.
The latter option is the subject of this inquiry.
Using a dependently typed language it is possible to encode statements and their proofs in the type system.

We use the Twelf proof assistant, which is based on the LF logical framework [citation Pfenning].
Twelf is dependently typed, but it is limited in other respects such as only being able to prove $\Pi_2$ ($\forall \exists$) theorems. [cite How to Believe a Twelf Proof?]
Hence, for a given statement it is not a priori clear whether Twelf is capable of proving (or even stating) it, even if a proof exists on paper.
On the other hand, Twelf has higher-order abstract syntax offering advantages when dealing with binders.

Our aim therefore is to investigate the feasibility of implementing a verified compiler using Twelf.

\section{Previous Work}

The main work in this area is the CompCert C verified compiler, a ``high-assurance compiler for almost all of the ISO C90 / ANSI C language, generating efficient code for the PowerPC, ARM and x86 processors'' [cite http://compcert.inria.fr/].
It targets embedded programming and is written almost entirely in Coq (exceptions being the parser and the assembly code pretty-printer).
Notably, the compiler implements non-trivial optimisations such as inlining.

The same framework has been used to make a compiler for mini-ML with progress towards verified garbage collection [cite Xavier Leroy].

Another project similarly achieves verified compilation for an ML-like language using Coq [cite Adam Chlipala].
The focus is on maintainability of the compiler, in particular using parameterised higher-order abstract syntax, while memory management is largely ignored.

\section{Overview}
Our source language, \hlang, is a simple higher-order functional language with substitution semantics.
The target language, \mlang, is a machine-like language featuring linearised programs with abstract stack machine semantics.

The translation employs two intermediate languages to more clearly separate the different aspects of the equivalence between \hlang and \mlang.

Firstly, named variables are turned into De Bruijn indices and closures are represented explicitly.
Secondly, the syntax is partially linearised and the semantics are based on an abstract machine.
Finally, the entire program is linearised.
