\begin{abstract}
Compilers are difficult to implement correctly; despite years of effort, even battle-tested compilers such as GCC are still susceptible to miscompilation.
Formal verification offers the possibility of machine-checked proofs of correctness.
With a verified compiler, it is merely necessary to trust the specification in order to have confidence in the implementation.

This report presents a compiler from a simple higher-order functional language to an imperative abstract stack machine language with an external program store.
It has been implemented in the Twelf proof assistant along with a proof of correctness.
In particular, the implementation contains a totality proof of a translation converting higher-order abstract syntax to a concrete representation.
