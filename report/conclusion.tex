% something about the full translation+equivalence? only in conclusion?

\section{Example}

% probably some differently title

% We have proved that the semantics are preserved during all translations.
% Nevertheless, it seems instructive to see the compilation process in action with a single example.
%
% Let us multiply two numbers.
% We define ...

\section{Future Work}

% heap objects --> garbage collection
% case in source language
% something recursion. instad of Y combinator.
% lower level, e.g. finite registers, single stack..
